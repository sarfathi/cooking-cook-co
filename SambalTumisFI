## [Sambal] (https://www.seriouseats.com/sambal-tumis-malaysian-chile-paste-7197954)
## Ingredients
*	2/3 ounce (19g) dried whole Kashmiri chiles (about 18-20 chiles), stemmed (see notes)
*	1 large red onion (12 ounces; 340g), roughly chopped
*	3 medium cloves garlic (15g)
*	3 ounces (85g) whole ikan bilis (Southeast Asian dried anchovies), cleaned (about 2 ounces/60g cleaned; see notes)
*	1 1/2 cups (355ml) neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, divided
*	1 1/2 tablespoons palm sugar (3/4 ounce; 20g), preferably gula Melaka (see notes)
*	2 tablespoons (30ml) tamarind concentrate, such as Tamicon 
*	Kosher salt

## Directions
* Blend the Ingredients
Blend the dried chilies, shallots, garlic, and shrimp paste into a smooth paste.

* Sauté the Chili Paste
Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the blended chili paste and sauté until the oil separates from the paste (pecah minyak), about 10–15 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid burning.

* Season the Sambal
Add sugar, salt, and tamarind juice. Stir until well combined. If you prefer a richer taste, add palm sugar. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.

* Cook Until Thick
Let the sambal simmer for another 5–10 minutes until it thickens and the oil separates again.

* Ready to Serve
Your sambal tumis is done! Serve it with rice, nasi lemak, or use it as a base for dishes like sambal squid or sambal prawns.
